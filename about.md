      <p class="intro">Hi, I’m <strong>Jiyeon Beack</strong>, a Master of Information Technology student at the University of Queensland, passionate about <strong>Machine Learning, Data Engineering, and building real-world solutions</strong>.</p>

      <p>Previously, I worked as a <strong>Data Scientist at Lotte Rental</strong> in South Korea, where I built machine learning models for used car price prediction and developed Tableau dashboards to support decision-making. I also launched internal Python training sessions and participated in mentoring programs to help others grow.</p>

      <p>After moving to Brisbane, I’ve been actively exploring end-to-end machine learning pipelines — from model development to deployment using <strong>Streamlit, Django, and AWS</strong>. I also enjoy simplifying complex concepts for others and currently tutor in data analysis and Python programming remotely for <strong>Sparta Coding Club</strong>.</p>
